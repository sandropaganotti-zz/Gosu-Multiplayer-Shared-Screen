This is a small proof-of-concept on how to build a multiplayer game server with Gosu;
there is just one screen for all the players, when a client connects a new player
is automatically added on the screen, when it disconnect the player is removed. 

This structure is useful when you need to create old-school multiplayer games 
that need to deal with more than two players and with more peripherals (eg: joypads, etc)

To try this out you need to first run the server (ruby init.rb) and then 
run as many clients as you want (ruby client/game_controller #playernum).

(use numbers insted of #playernum eg 0,1,2,3... :)
